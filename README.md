# DenseGEMM gpgpusim simulation

1. Build Accelsim (https://github.com/accel-sim/accel-sim-framework.git) according to the README.md of Accelsim

2. Use this repository (modified gpgpusim) instead of gpgpu-sim_)distribution (https://github.com/accel-sim/gpgpu-sim_distribution.git)

3. git clone https://github.com/yspark623/cutlass.git and build according to README.md

4. run examples/00_basic_gemm with ptx simulation mode
